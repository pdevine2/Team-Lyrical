Code Development for Lyrical Team Project

MetroLyrics_Web_Crawler_v6 developed by Brandon Nipper for the Capstone Project

1.  Code is designed to break up the tasks of data acquistion among 5 team members.
2.  URLs are organized by letter of the alphabet.
3.  Approach of team members is to comment out letters except the one working on and run the code.
4.  Output is a csv file with the data of the bands beginning with the letter run.
5.  Bands beginning with numeric characters were run in a early version of the code and the csv for bands beginning with numbers were captured first (e.g., 38 Special, 10CC, ...)
